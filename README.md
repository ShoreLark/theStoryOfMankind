The Story of Mankind
=================

*by Hendrik Van Loon*


> HIGH Up in the North in the land called Svithjod, there
stands a rock. It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles
wide. Once every thousand years a little bird comes to this
rock to sharpen its beak.

> When the rock has thus been worn away, then a single day
of eternity will have gone by.
