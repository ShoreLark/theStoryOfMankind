34. BUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT QUARRELS WERE FORGOTTEN WHEN
 THE TURKS TOOK THE HOLY LAND, DESECRATED THE HOLY
 PLACES AND INTERFERED SERIOUSLY WITH THE TRADE FROM
 EAST TO WEST. EUROPE WENT CRUSADING
35. WHY THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES SAID THAT CITY AIR
 IS FREE AIR
36. HOW THE PEOPLE OF THE CITIES ASSERTED THEIR RIGHT
 TO BE HEARD IN THE ROYAL COUNCILS OF THEIR COUNTRY
37. WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES THOUGHT OF THE
 WORLD IN WHICH THEY HAPPENED TO LIVE
38. HOW THE CRUSADES ONCE MORE MADE THE MEDITERRANEAN A
 BUSY CENTRE OF TBADE AND HOW THE CITIES OF THE ITALIAN
 PENINSULA BECAME THE GREAT DISTRIBUTING CENTRE FOR THE
 COMMERCE WITH ASIA AND AFRICA
39. PEOPLE ONCE MORE DARED TO BE HAPPY JUST BECAUSE THEY
 WERE ALIVE. THEY TRIED TO SAVE THE REMAINS OF THE
 OLDER AND MORE AGREEABLE CIVILISATION OF ROME AND
 GREECE AND THEY WERE 80 PROUD OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS
 THAT THEY SPOKE OF A RENAISSANCE OR RE-BIRTH OF
 CIVILISATION
40. THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO FEEL THE NEED OF GIVING EXPRESSION
 TO THEIR NEWLY DISCOVERED JOY OF LIVING. THEY EXPRESSED
 THEIR HAPPINES9 IN POETRY AND IN SCULPTURE AND
 IN ARCHITECTURE AND PAINTING, AND IN THE BOOKS THEY
 PRINTED
41. BUT NOW THAT PEOPLE HAD BROKEN THROUGH THE BONDS OF
 THEIR NARROW ~IEDIIEVAL LIMITATIONS, THEY HAD TO HAVE
 MORE ROOM FOR THEIR WANDERINGS. THE EUROPEAN WORLD
 HAD GROWN TOO SMALL FOR THEIR AMBITIONS. IT WAS THE
 TIME OF THE GREAT VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY
42. CONCERNING BUDDHA AND CONFUCIUS
43. THE PROGRESS OF THE HUMAN RACE IS BEST COMPARED TO A
 GIGANTIC PENDULUM WHICH FOREVER SWINGS FORWARD AND
 BACKWARD. THE RELIGIOUS INDIFFERENCE AND THE ARTISTIC
 AND LITERARY ENTHUSIASM OF THE RENAISSANCE WERE FOLLOWED
 BY THE ARTISTIC AND LITERARY INDIFFERENCE AND THE
 RELIGIOITS ENTHUSIASM OF THE REFORMATION
44. THE AGE OF THE GREAT RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSIES
45. HOW THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS
 AND THE LESS DIVINE BUT MORE REASONABLE RIGHT OF
 PARLIAMENT ENDED DISASTROUSLY FOR KING CHARLES II
46. IN FRANCE, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS
 CONTINUED WITH GREATER POMP AND SPLENDOR THAN EVER
 BEFORE AND THE AMBITION OF THE RULER WAS ONLY TEMPERED
 BY THE NEWLY INVENTED LAW OF THE BALANCE OF POWER
47. THE STORY OF THE MYSTERIOUS MUSCOVITE EMPIRE WHICH SUDDENLY
 BURST UPON THE GRAND POLITICAL STAGE OF EUROPE
48. RUSSIA AND SWEDEN FOUGHT MANY WARS TO DECIDE WHO
 SHALL BE THE LEADING POWER OF NORTHEASTERN EUROPE
49. THE EXTRAORDINARY RISE OF A LITTLE STATE IN A DREARY PART
 OF NORTHERN GERMANY, CALLED PRUSSIA
50. HOW THE NEWLY FOUNDED NATIONAL OR DYNASTIC STATES OF
 EUROPE TRIED TO MAKE THEMSELVES RICH AND WHAT WAS
 MEANT BY THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM
51. AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY EUROPE HEARD
 STRANGE REPORTS OF SOMETHING WHICH HAD HAPPENED IN
 THE WILDERNESS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTINENT. THE
 DESCENDANTS OF THE MEN WHO HAD PUNISHED KING CHARLES
 FOR HIS INSISTENCE UPON HIS DIVINE RIGHTS ADDED A
 NEW CHAPTER TO THE OLD STORY OF THE STRUGGLE FOR SELF-
 GOVERNMENT
62. THE GREAT FRENCH REVOLUTION PROCLAIMS THE PRINCIPLES
 OF LIBERTY, FRATERNITY AND EQUALITY UNTO All THE PEOPLE
 OF THE EARTH
53. NAPOLEON
54. AS SOON AS NAPOLEON HAD BEEN SENT TO ST. HELENA, THE
 RULERS WHO SO OFTEN HAD BEEN DEFEATED BY THE HATED
 CORSICAN MET AT VIENNA AND TRIED TO UNDO THE MANY
 CHANCES WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE FRENCH
 REVOLUTION
55. THEY TRIED TO ASSURE THE WORLD AN ERA OF UNDISTURBED
 PEACE BY SUPPRESSING ALL NEW IDEAS. THEY MADE THE
 POLICE-SPY THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARY IN THE STATE AND
 SOON THE PRISONS OF AIL COUNTRIES WERE FILLED WITH
 THOSE WHO CLAIMED THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO
 GOVERN THEMSELVES AS THEY SEE FIT
56. THE LOVE OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE, HOWEVER, WAS TOO
 STRONG TO BE DESTROYED IN THIS WAY. THE SOUTH AMERICANS
 WERE THE FIRST TO REBEL AGAINST THE REACTIONARY
 MEASURES OF THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA. GREECE AND BELGIUM
 AND SPAIN AND A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES
 OF THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT FOLLOWED SUIT AND THE
 NINETEENTH CENTURY WAS FILLED WITH THE RUMOR OF MANY
 WARS OF INDEPENDENCE
57. BUT WHITE THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE WERE FIGHTING FOR THEIR
 NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE, THE WORLD IN WHICH THEY LIVED
 HAD BEEN ENTIRELY CHANGED BY A SERIES OF INVENTIONS,
 WHICH HAD MADE THE CLUMSY OLD STEAM-ENGINE OF THE
 EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE MOST FAITHFUL AND EFFICIENT
 STAVE OF MAN
58. THE NEW ENGINES WERE VERY EXPENSIVE AND ONLY PEOPLE
 OF WEALTH COULD AFFORD THEM. THE OLD CARPENTER OR
 SHOEMAKER WHO HAD BEEN HIS OWN MASTER IN HIS LITTLE
 WORKSHOP WAS OBLIGED TO HIRE HIMSELF OUT TO THE OWNERS
 OF THE BIG MECHANICAL TOOLS, AND WHITE HE MADE
 MORE MONEY THAN BEFORE, HE LOST HIS FORMER INDEPENDENCE
 AND HE DID NOT LIKE THAT
59. THE GENERAL INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY DID NOT BRING
 ABOUT THE ERA OF HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY WHICH HAD
 BEEN PREDICTED BY THE GENERATION WHICH SAW THE STAGE
 COACH REPLACED BY THE RAILROAD. SEVERAL REMEDIES
 WERE SUGGESTED, BUT NONE OF THESE QUITE SOLVED THE
 PROBLEM
60. BUT THE WORLD HAD UNDERGONE ANOTHER CHANGE WHICH WAS
 OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN EITHER THE POLITICAL OR THE
 INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS. AFTER GENERATIONS OF OPPRESSION
 AND PERSECUTION, THE SCIENTIST HAD AT LAST GAINED
 LIBERTY OF ACTION AND HE WAS NOW TRYING TO DISCOVER
 THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE UNIVERSE
61. A CHAPTER OF ART
62. THE LAST FIFTY YEARS, INCLUDING SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS
AND A FEW APOLOGIES
